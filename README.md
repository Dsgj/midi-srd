# Midi-SRD
A compendium pack for SRD items, feats etc configured for use with Dynamic Active Effects as well as Midi QOL. <hr>


Midi SRD was created by Kandashi to help users, providing Items ready to use with MidiQOL automation module.

Using functions provided by MidiQOL, Dynamic Active Effects and Warpgate, it expands on the functionality of many Items and Spells provided by the dnd5e system.

You can find these items, in the three included compendiums, labeled:
Midi SRD Feats,
Midi SRD Items,
Midi SRD Spells.



Note from thatlonelybugbear.

I will be updating this module for the time being! I want to say a big thanks to Kandashi for all that he has done for Foundry's community :)

Last week of March a more complete update will be released, with Items/Spells etc reworked to utilise newer MidiQOL functions for automation.
At the same time, MidiSRD will be leaning more heavily on another really helpful module, Warpgate.

More on this hopefully soon. 

Happy rolling and keep in mind that bugbears are friendly!

### Things to note
- Do **not** have item macros with character sheet hooks enabled while using this module
    - If you get an error such as `last args is not defined` this is the cause
