# Midi-SRD
A compendium pack for SRD items, feats etc configured for use with Dynamic Active Effects as well as Midi QOL.

The partner module to this, the <a href="https://github.com/kandashi/Dynamic-Effects-SRD/" target="_blank">DAE-SRD</a> has all of these items configured for **only** DAE if thats what you require
--

### Things to note
- Do **not** have item macros with character sheet hooks enabled while using this module
    - If you get an error such as `last args is not defined` this is the cause
